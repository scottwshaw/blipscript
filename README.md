1. Open the script file "populate-numbered blips.graffle" or
"populate-labled-quadrant.scpt" in the AppleScript editor

2. Open the file "open-before-running-script.graffle" in OmniGraffle
Professional 5 (script refers to this specific version

3. Click "run" in the AppleScript editor

Note: to run with a different version of OmniGraffle, edit the references to OmniGraffle Professional 5" in the script editor to refer to the version you're running.

ToDo
====

* make scripts to create labeled blips in one quadrant at a time
* have the script read the blip data from a file rather than embedding
  it in the script
* make the script better
